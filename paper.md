# Summary

Approaches to identifying sex-chromosome sequences in genome assemblies: Sex-detector (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27492231/); synteny/ identity search; 
Classical methods like FISH (https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/15113)

# Statement of need

Identifying sex-chromosomes in scaffold- or contig- level genome assemblies is of significance both for practical reasons, such as aiding in the development of sex-deterministic markers (<CITE>)


# Performance and testing
